# Hi, I'm Wilfredo üòÅ
Can you really create a great resume without any experience?

Truth is, anyone can create a resume. Resumes are just a mere reflection of what you as an individual is truly capable of bringing to a company. The same way some professional athletes are bad during practice but great on gamedays, there are individuals who can't sell their skills to the public, but are valuable assets to any company. All it takes is one person to take a chance, so the purpose of a resume is to help find one perso to take a look at your resume.

The most valuable skills that I learned in college were soft skills. The ability to sell yourself to the public and virtually anyone is vital in surviving. As a business major, I was always told that I'd have to learn to seperate myself from my peers. When applying for a job and filling out the skills section, anyone can say they are, "Detail Oriented", or "Self-starter". These skills are expected in jobs that require more out of you, especially those that pay well. Company's want to see what you can add to their team that no one else has. In a way, how unique are you. What skills, experience, or differences can you add to a team that already is established. 

Without giving away everything in this introduction, the purpose of my website is to help individuals, from college students, adults who are unhappy with their jobs, or recent graduates in creating a strong resume. I've used my years of experience working in the restaurant, finance, and supply-chain industry to help share what has helped me land jobs in a time of need. In addiiton, I utilized my education and networkig tools to help me understand what makes a resume great. I've been to the go to person when it comes to helping my family, friends, and co-workers create resumes and I want to continue to share this infomation with everyone who needs it.
